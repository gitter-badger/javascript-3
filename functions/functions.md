## Functions [**Back**](./../README.md)

#### 1. Use function declarations

- To use function declarations instead of function expressions.

> the reason is that function declarations are named, so they are easier to identify in call stacks. Also, the whole body of a function declarations is hoisted(提升), whereas(然而) only the reference of a function expression is needed to be hoisted. This rule makes it possible to always use [*Arrow Functions*](./../arrowFunctions/arrowFunctions.md) in place of function expressions.
